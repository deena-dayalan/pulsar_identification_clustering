# Pulsar identification and clustering using Machine Learning techniques
Pulsars are remains of a big start that exploded near the end of it's life. This tiny star is spinning and as it spins, it emits radio wave around the sky. Pulsating Star emit energy in the form of electromagnetic pulses that are recognized by radio telescopes. This periodic signals can be identified by traditional pulsar search algorithm, but its hard to differentiate real pulsar signal and Radio Frequency Interference. But this problem can be solved by employing machine learning algorithms.
